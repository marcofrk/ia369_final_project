    "# Improving Machine Learning Experience With Multimedia Techniques\n",

    "## *Abstract*\n",
    "\n",
    "*It has been very common face machine learning algorithms at the multimedia area: traffic count; real-time vigilance cameras; baggage tracker; face/expression recognition; and so on. It is so common that it was designed a name for it, Machine Vision. However, it is perceptive the gap between machine learning and multimedia solutions, where even at simple embedded systems it is possible to reach 4k videos running at 60 frames per second, whereas the best neural network solution only handles 224x224 frames at 300 milliseconds in the same system. Due to this, a vast number of solutions as being developed: dedicated hardware for inference process; model manipulation; accelerated pre-processing image solutions; and video manipulation techniques. This paper is based at the study of these videos manipulation techniques, exposing the most common algorithmics, such as frame-skip, frame-droop, resizing, color convert, and overlay solutions; and showing the main difference between them, when the solution can be applied, and the expected performance for each one.*\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Aiming to diminish the gap between the machine learning inference process and the multimedia capability, which reaches 4k@60fps, some video manipulation solutions was purposed. Among them, the most common is the overlay solutions, which are able to create alpha layers over the video and insert information on it. These overlays are very common on object detections algorithmics, once they are responsible for drawing a square, select or color an object at the scene. The most common overlays are Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Cairo, and OpenCV.\n",
    "In addition to the overlays, it is important to use a great video framework able to handle all the elements involved at the inference and display solutions. One of the best and most useful ones is the GStreamer framework. GStreamer is able to handle plugins in pipelines, which is perfect to do quick tests.\n",
    "Apart from the video solutions, it is important to choose the best machine learning algorithmics as well. With a focus on object detection, the most common and valued ones are Single Shot Detection (SSD) and Tensorflow. Both have an incredible inference process capability and the TFlite version demonstrated a great tool for embedded systems.\n",
    "Thus, with all the tools chosen, this paper intends to compare the combination of theses algorithmics for object detection solutions. This comparison aims to demonstrate how we can increase the video frame rate with simple approaches and demonstrate the best scenarios to handle each neural network algorithmics and the overlays plugins behavior on these tests."

    "### GStreamer and V4L2\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, this paper uses GStreamer framework to reproduce the videos files.\n",
    "For the comparison purpose, the following approaches will be performed:\n",
    "* OpenCV V4L2 directly handle;\n",
    "* GStreamer appsink pipeline + OpenCV V4L2 output;\n",
    "* GStreamer appsink + appsrc pipelines;\n",
    "* GStreamer overlay plugins support.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow below describes the difference between each process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic Object Detection workflow can be described as an input Layer (an image, for instance), being processed by some Hidden Layers (model), and resulting in an Ouput Layer (square over an object and a label on it). So basically a model was used to identify some objects in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this basic workflow will only work if the input layer has the same image size and color format expected for the model, i.e, in order to perform an Object Detection, an image pre-processing is required. Also, if it is expected to display the results in the same image, so an image pos-processing is required as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To become it more complex, take a video file as source instead of an image, and before considering each frame as an image, the video will require a decoding process, and than the frames will be pre-processed, calculated the results by the model, pos-processed, and than displayed with the label results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can split the Video Object Detection workflow into the following five steps:\n",
    "* 1- Input data;\n",
    "* 2- Image Pre-processing; \n",
    "* 3- Inference process;\n",
    "* 4- Image Pos-processing;\n",
    "* 5- Output data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OpenCV V4L2 directly handle:**\n",
    "![opencv](../data/images/opencv_v4l2.png)\n",
    "The easiest way to perform Video Object Detection is by using OpenCV to perform the entire workflow process:\n",
    "* 1 - OpenCV uses Video4Linux (V4L2), a collection of device drivers and an API for supporting realtime video capture on Linux systems, which enable the user to pass a video file, image, or camera as Input Frames. OpenCV will handle it without any improvements.\n",
    "* 2 - OpenCV will take one-by-one Input Frame, pre-processing it, which includes color convert and image scaling, creating a Pre-processed Frame.\n",
    "* 3 - Here, the Pre-processed Frame is sent to the model, and then the inference process return the Resulted Frame.\n",
    "* 4 - The Resulted Frame is manipulated again by the OpenCV, drawing the squares, label, font colors, and etc. Then, the Resulted Frame is again scaled and applied a color convert, returning a Post-processed Frame.\n",
    "* 5 - In the end, OpenCV uses V4l2 to display the Post-processed Frame at the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coast of this approach is the impossibility to improve the video capture/display, plus the fact of OpenCV has to handle all the five steps, being overloaded all the time."

    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the object detection algorithms consume a lot of process resources, and the notebooks have no performance enough to handle it. However, it was still able to show the difference at the inference time and the framerate, both running together and consuming the same CPU process.\n",
    "According to the values obtained, noticed that the number of about 0.5 milliseconds is far from the expected for a video object detection solution. With some simples calculations, it is easy to note that 0.5 ms of inference time represents 2 frames being calculated per second. It is very slow and it is far from the multimedia capabilities, which can achieve 60 frames per second."

     "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a systematic comparison of various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization using six carefully chosen test functions. Each test function involves a particular feature that is known to cause difficulty in the evolutionary optimization process, mainly in converging to the Pareto-optimal front (e.g., multimodality and deception). By investigating these different problem features separately, it is possible to predict the kind of problems to which a certain technique is or is not well suited. However, in contrast to what was suspected beforehand, the experimental results indicate a hierarchy of the algorithms under consideration. Furthermore, the emerging effects are evidence that the suggested test functions provide sufficient complexity to compare multiobjective optimizers. Finally, elitism is shown to be an important factor for improving evolutionary multiobjective search.",
